                <h2>Background Information</h2>
                <p>Peace Island is located in the Caribbean Sea, just south of Jamaica. Explorer Rishabh Jain discovered the uninhabited island in early 2021. Rishabh Jain was inspired by the peaceful and calming sounds created by the wind and water, hence the name Peace Island. Rishabh Jain has since developed the island as the King. In 30 years, with lots of hard work, Rishabh Jain has completely transformed the Island into a desirable country to live in and visit for vacations.</p>
